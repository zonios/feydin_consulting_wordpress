    Marketing anarchy in the iPhone range?
  </h2>
  <p>
    To introduce this article please let me give you an insight into the Apple commercial results: At the end of 2017, iPhone sales accounted for 51% of global smartphone revenues (61.4 billions dollars vs 120 billions estimated total). So we can easily consider this product as an ultra strategic cash maker for Apple.
    <br><br>
    <i>But last year the Apple Marketing team threw sand in the gears. And I was expecting some issues regarding the perceived logic of the Apple iPhone portfolio since the launch of the model X.</i>
    <br><br>
    At this time, I was very surprised by the launch of the iPhone 9 and 10 at the same time. But also by the fact that they have decided to change the nomenclature of their flagship choosing a letter instead of an Arabic numeral. Could you imagine BMW developing their série 1,2,3,4,5,6 and launching the flagship série VII? I believe that this should be incompatible with a logical German engineer mind, right? It was obviously not a blocking point in Cupertino!
    <br><br>
    First consequence is that some journalists and customers pronounced the letter X instead of saying 10. Second negative consequence, the iPhone 9 was not considered as a sexy and performing smartphone but rather as the "poor man" iPhoneX. This confusion was reinforced by the fact that Apple keeps now oldest models longer in distribution.
    <br><br>
    By the way this extended range is for me a good thing in order to propose to consumers a wider price proposal but also secure their investment on a longer term.
    <br><br>
    The iPhone 9 was consequently not a commercial success. This is proven that the 9 simply disappeared from the range creating a new hole in the range between the 8 and the X. This hole looks like a dangerous imaginary frontier between the old and the new models of the portfolio.
    <br><br>
    <i>This hole should be fulfilled by the iPhone Xr which is more or less presented as a smaller and less powerful iPhone Xs. And now it is becoming once again counter intuitive considering that everywhere in the World, the two letters X and S associated means in consumer's minds: eXtra Small. This is the opposite of the flagship smartphone main characteristic! </i>
    <br><br>
    Rumors before the keynote announced that the naming could be Xmax and Xc.Doing so, Xc could be associated with "compact". This was much more logical in my opinion, the ex 9 being smaller (5.2") than the previous X (5.8").
    <br><br>
    Despite these Marketing mistakes, I do not worry too much for Apple as they are making outstanding products with a lot of credibility and appeal on the Electronic high-end Market.
    <br><br>
    I am a fan of this 1 trillion $ company so you will understand that I expect perfection from them...even regarding the product nomenclature.
